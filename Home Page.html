                  <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> Most people will not win against the house when making bets either in house or online. According to JV Miller, writing for his newsletter, states that professional sports bettors rarely sustain a long-term winning percentage higher than 55 percent, and it's often as low as 53 or 54 percent. This means even the professionals are hardly making money when it comes to sports betting.</p>

                      <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> We queried through our data set to make the best data columns in order to optimize our machine learning process. We took a variety of our data and simplifies it into a 0 or 1 answer in order to make our process of machine learning as simple as possible for example we changed for our over under prediction we made a column where 1 was over the bet and 0 was under the bet. This makes predicting the outcome much easier for our machine learning.</p>

                 <strong>From our project we hope to better inform people about Vegas and its odds</strong>

                    After working through all of what we have presented we hope that many will be better informed to be more confident in making a winning bet. There are many different factors that go into what makes the Vegas odds and opened the hood on some of these with the most important being the total score.

          Here is what we found!
        </h4>
        <p class="container mt-4 mb-3" style="text-indent: 40px">
          Our machine learning program got an accuracy rating over 88% when working with our test data. This means that it accurately predicted 88% of the time when the over or under hit predicting around 56% of the time the over will hit. To understand how our machine learning program was making this determination we decided to look at which feature was most important for our program. What we found was that our 5th feature was the most important which was the total score. This makes a ton of sense as the total score is what is the over/under line is based upon. That however doesn't mean that the other features were completely useless, they still had an impact on our program.

          Exploring our results - Vegas Line VS Season Averages
        </h4>
        <p class="container mt-4 mb-3" style="text-indent: 40px">
          We wanted to do a deep dive into the data behind our machine learning project in order to give a better idea for people who want to sports bet as well as give a more complete image of what is going behind the scenes with our program. What we first took a look as was the over under line versus the total score on average on an annual basis. Below is the our visualization of this comparison. As seen, the over under line and the total score are closely related throughout the years with occasional spike in the average total score compared to the over under line. However, based on the averages it looks like the total score is consistently more than the Vegas line in the beginning years and becomes more equal in the later seasons.
